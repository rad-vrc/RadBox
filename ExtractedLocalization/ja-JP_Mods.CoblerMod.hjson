		DislikeNPC: The golfer is someone who would have no maidens. I do not wish to see him.
		LoveNPC: The Arms Dealer has seen things himself in his life. I can tell that we'll get along just fine.
		LikeNPC: The Pirate knows a thing or two about the letter R. I must know what it is.

		LikeBiome: It's peaceful down here. Only the sounds of minecart tracks every now and then.

	Sorcerer: {
		HateNPC: When are we getting ride of R2-PO over there? His mechs are stenching up this place! =(

		LoveNPC: There's the wizard! I hope he's able to play catch the wyveryn later today!
		LikeNPC: The Dryad is capable of very strong plant magic. Perhaps I should introduce myself...

		LikeBiome: A small but delightful biome. This is what I enjoy.
		DislikeCrowded: There's too many people here. I'm about to start blasting!
		FarFromHome: It would appear I took my broom a little too far from home...
		LoveSpace: The space here is refreshing. No demons in sight to annoy me either.
		NoHome: No tower to continue my research in. Better go practice my magic again.
		Content: Magic is something we are all capable of. And the mana inside each of us has no boundaries.

	Psychokinetic: {
		HateNPC: Why do I have to be by the Party Girl? She's loud enough on the outside, it's even worse in her mind!
		DislikeNPC: I tried reading the Pirates mind once. It was a lot of R's and not much else.
		LoveNPC: The Witch Doctor is so fascinating to listen to! I don't even know half of what he thinks but it's very cool!
		HateBiome: It's so boring here! Let me know when you have a new home ready for me to leave here.
		DislikeBiome: What's so good about this biome anyway? I can't read anything here.
		LikeNPC: You think the Wizard is capable of reading mind too?! I'm gonna go ask!
		LoveBiome: ... ... ... Oh were you talking to me? Sorry this biome just had a higher priority! ... ... ...
		LikeBiome: I don't see how people dislike this biome! There's so much you can learn from the creatures!
		DislikeCrowded: Too many people! My mind can't read this much at once!
		FarFromHome: Is it possible to read my mind from the past? I think that'll help me find my way home.
		LoveSpace: I love the amount of space here! I can practice firing my missiles!
		NoHome: Nowhere to call home. I'll just read this worms mind and see what he does to survive...
		Content: What're you thinking about? JK JK I know what you're thinking about!

	Herbalist: {
		HateNPC: Ugh. Could that Demo Man destroy anymore of this pretty wildlife? =(
		DislikeNPC: The Witch Doctor isn't looking at me right now right? I don't trust it...
		LoveNPC: The dryad is like the sister I never had... I want to talk more about plants with her...
